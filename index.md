## About ME

My name is Dyava Rama Krishna Reddy and I am a roboticist. I did my Master in Automation and Robotics Engineering at Technical university of Munich (Germany) and University of Siena (Italy) and I had finished my bachelor degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering. Mostly, my research is driven into medical and surgical robotic system. I have been working as mechantronics, Algorithms develoeprs and Systems Control Architrecture.
