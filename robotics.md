## Introduction to Experimental Research

I would like to discuss my major research interests and experience. Firstly, I did my internship in Sensors and Microsystems (2015-2016) where I have gain lot of knowledge on
- robotics
- sensors: force, strain, Chemical, Temperature sensors and at the same time, I worked with the electronic front-end circuits and electronic design software. Later I have moved to the robotics platform which makes me excited into thiseld and soon I had very good command of robotics like Human-Centered Robotics and Haptics.

 Certainly, I had joined in the University of Siena laboratory for doing the project on human-robot interaction methods, also there I have worked in Hapticseld (Rendering and Fingertip
wearable haptics device).1 Later I moved to the Technical University of Munich for Master's thesis and the internship on Haptics feedback in direct physical human-robot interaction. Also, I took the course of "Introduction of Surgical Robotics". I worked in German Aerospace Centre (DLR) at Robotics and Mechatronics Department on Performance
of the Surgical robotics ( MIRO robot). Currently, I am working at [SS innovations,China] ( http://www.ssinnovations.org/ ) as Mechatronics on Medical robots like teleoperated and single arm medical arm application.


## Experience with Surgical and Medical Robotics

My current work is motion planning of multi-arm Mantra teleoperated system and single-arm medical robotic application. For the multi-arm teleoperated system 1(a), I mostly deal with
system actuators kinematics with individual motion and cooperative motion, and joint links specications for overall system in ACTIN software (It is specically developed for Mantra
surgical robot). Especially, for single arms medical robots 1(b) such as automated robotic endoscope camera and robotic ultrasound probe I do motion planning with ROS and Panda Franka software. Also, my major research is going on automated endoscope camera manipulation while surgeon doing surgery in extending semi and fully automated ultrasound probe by using 7DOF manipulators.

I have worked with the MIRO surgical robot which is a versatile system robot (DLR). MIRO aims at a compact, slim and lightweight robot arm as a versatile core component for various existing and future medical robotic procedures. With its low weight of 10 kg and dimensions similar to those of the human arm, the MIRO robot can assist the surgeon directly at the operating table without interference. Also, One or more MIRO robots are telemanipulated by the surgeon from a distant control interface for example in endoscopic
surgery.

I have worked on testing the MIRO performance of the manipulator and surgery devices. When robots are working with the patients, it is mandatory to know the errors and deviations for the medical robot for that I am working with evaluation on performance tests by
calculating the deviations of the MIRO robot in terms of Pose Accuracy, Distance accuracy , Multi-directional accuracy, Exchangeable orientations accuracy, position overshoot and some other performance tests according to the ISO 9283.

## Human motion guidance using vibrotactile feedback in direct physical human-robot physical interaction
In physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) tasks such as cooperative object manipulation,
the robot traditionally adapts its motion to a desired trajectory imposed by the human
partner. However, certain areas in the workspace of the human-robot team can be unfeasible
(inadmissible). I am using wearable vibrotactile haptics wristband, which is suitable feedback
can be conveyed to the human partner, enhancing the human-robot interaction
### Problem Statement:
In this research work the physical human-robot team (pHRT) carries an object from the
initial to target position. Figure. 3 shows the cooperatively manipulation of the object
between the human and robot, which leads towards the target position. Importantly, In our
work the pHRTI moves the object along a trajectory the following problems have to solve
for achieving the feasible path for HRT.
