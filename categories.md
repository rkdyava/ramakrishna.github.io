Basically Basic is a [Jekyll theme](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) meant as a substitute for the default --- [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima). Conventions and features found there are fully supported by **Basically Basic**, with a few enhancements thrown in for good measure:

- Clean responsive design with [six customizable skins](#skin)
- Curriculum Vit√¶/Resume layout powered by [JSON data](http://registry.jsonresume.org/)
- About page layout
- Disqus Comments and Google Analytics support
- SEO best practices via [Jekyll SEO Tag](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-seo-tag/)

Currently, I am working as a Mechatronics Engineering at SS innovations **(@medical robotics)**. I had done my graduation in Electrical and Electronic Engineering in the year 2013 from JNTUH university
and post-graduation in Computer and Automation (specialization in Robotics) from University of Siena in the year 2017. In all the years of my work, research and study I tried to develop a good sense of research.

The passion towards to medical robotics was starting when I was working at DLR, there I was developing a software and conducting performance tests on existing system MIRO surgical robot. Since then I have been studying and doing research in this medical robotics field and also during my
work at DLR I overcame many performance errors and develop software according to minimize the error at a different level of MIRO robot. Also, I had given some presentations at DLR and TUM on percutaneous coronary intervention robotic surgery procedure and minimal invasive surgical robotic
system and a lot of case study on PCI disease and surgical procedure.

I had done my Master's thesis in direct human-robot interaction with the haptic device, this was added to medical robots' research.
After, I gain medical robots knowledge I was doing self-research on many existing medical robots like
- DaVinci
-  FreeHand
-  Leoni . . .

After, getting into SS innovations (my current job employer) I have been doing a lot of research on motion planning of the minimal invasive surgical robot (Mantra) and also I am leading the person to develop single arm robotic application such as robotic endoscope camera and ultrasound robotic
probe holder. I have been doing many motion planning for single arm medical application with ROS and Franka robotic arms.
I was very interested in developing new methods of single arm medical robot with the advanced technology. I had done motion planning for single arm medical robotic application on "Franka Emika" manipulator arm at SS innovations and constantly working out to build effective commercial medical
robots like endoscope robotic camera and ultrasound robotic probe scanner.
In this process, I have traveled and attended many national and international conferences on medical robotics, one which is 79th China International Medical Equipment Fair (CMEF Spring) at Shanghai, China.

I would like to write a paper on some of my research results in future. I regularly watch and read many research articles on medical robotics and always keep me update on this field.
I have a sound knowledge of the advanced technologies and software that are most importantly needed in Medical Robotics. I gained excellent skills in 6/7DOF manipulator kinematics and dynamics for a different kind of application.
